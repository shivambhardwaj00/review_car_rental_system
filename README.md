# Car Rental System

This Java-based Car Rental System allows users to rent and return cars. It manages the cars, customers, and rentals, providing a user-friendly interface via the command line. The system enables customers to view available cars, rent them for a specified number of days, and return them once they are done.

## Features

- **Rent a Car**: Customers can select an available car and rent it for a specified number of days. The system calculates the total rental price based on the carâ€™s daily rate.
- **Return a Car**: Customers can return rented cars, marking them as available for other users.
- **Menu-based Interface**: A simple text-based menu is presented to the user for navigation.
- **Car Management**: The system supports adding cars, each with unique details like brand, model, and base price per day.
- **Customer Management**: Customers are assigned unique IDs upon renting a car, and their information is stored in the system.
